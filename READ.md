README: Services Monitor Program
Overview
The Services Monitor Program is a C++ application designed to list all the services running on your Windows system, along with their statuses and associated process IDs. It replicates a portion of the functionality of the Windows services.msc interface, allowing you to view which services are active or stopped and providing additional details like the process ID of each service.

This program will automatically stop after 10 seconds, displaying all the services' statuses in the console.

Features
Lists all services (active and stopped) on the system.
Displays:
Service Name: The internal name of the service.
Display Name: The user-friendly name of the service.
Status: Whether the service is running or stopped.
Process ID: The ID of the process managing the service (if applicable).
Automatically exits after displaying the information for 10 seconds.
How It Works
Service Control Manager (SCM):

The program connects to the Windows Service Control Manager using the OpenSCManager function.
Enumerate Services:

Uses the Windows API function EnumServicesStatusEx to retrieve information about all services.
Display Services:

The details of each service, including its name, status, and associated process ID, are printed to the console in a readable format.
Auto-Exit:

The program automatically terminates after 10 seconds using the Sleep(10000) function.
Prerequisites
Operating System: Windows.
C++ Compiler:
MSYS2 with GCC.
Ensure the win32api headers (windows.h, tchar.h) are available.
Administrator Privileges:
The program accesses the Service Control Manager, which requires elevated privileges. Run your console as Administrator.
Steps to Compile and Execute
1. Compilation
Use the following command in your MSYS console to compile the program:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o services_monitor services_monitor.cpp -lstdc++ -lkernel32 -luser32 -ladvapi32
services_monitor.cpp: The name of the source file.
services_monitor: The name of the output executable.
2. Execution
Run the compiled executable:

bash
Copy code
./services_monitor
3. Administrator Mode
To ensure proper execution, run the MSYS console in Administrator mode:

Right-click on your MSYS shortcut.
Select Run as Administrator.
Sample Output
When executed, the program outputs the status of all services in the following format:

yaml
Copy code
Fetching list of services and their statuses...
Service Name: wuauserv
Display Name: Windows Update
Status: Running
Process ID: 1234
--------------------------
Service Name: sppsvc
Display Name: Software Protection
Status: Stopped
Process ID: 0
--------------------------
Exiting in 10 seconds...
Limitations
Process Descriptions:
The program does not include the detailed description of services. You can extend it using the QueryServiceConfig function.
10-Second Timeout:
The program stops after 10 seconds. Adjust the Sleep(10000) function to change the duration.
Customization Options
List Active Services Only:
Modify SERVICE_STATE_ALL to SERVICE_ACTIVE in the EnumServicesStatusEx call.
Add Additional Information:
Use other Windows API functions, such as QueryServiceStatus or QueryServiceConfig, to fetch more details.
Troubleshooting
If the program fails with an error such as:
vbnet
Copy code
Failed to open Service Control Manager. Error: <error_code>
Ensure that:
You are running the program in Administrator Mode.
Your environment has access to the required libraries.

This program was designed to provide insight into Windows background services using the C++ Windows API. It can be further extended to meet more specific monitoring needs.




FOR NORMAL LIST_PROCESSES: 

README: Running Processes Monitor Program
Overview
The Running Processes Monitor Program is a C++ application designed to display all running processes on your Windows system in real-time. It lists each process's name and process ID (PID), providing insight into the active tasks on your system.

The program refreshes the list every second for 10 seconds and then stops automatically.

Features
Real-Time Process Monitoring:
Continuously lists all running processes.
Displays:
Process Name: The name of the executable.
Process ID (PID): The unique identifier of the process.
Auto-Exit After 10 Seconds:
The program runs for 10 seconds before stopping.
Console Refresh:
The console clears after each refresh to provide a cleaner view of the process list.
How It Works
Snapshot of Running Processes:

The program uses the Windows API function CreateToolhelp32Snapshot to capture the state of all running processes.
Process Enumeration:

Processes are iterated through using Process32First and Process32Next.
Real-Time Updates:

The process list is refreshed every second using a separate thread.
Program Termination:

The program stops monitoring after 10 seconds.
Prerequisites
Operating System: Windows.
C++ Compiler:
MSYS2 with GCC.
Ensure the win32api headers (windows.h, tlhelp32.h) are available.
Administrator Privileges:
Run your console as Administrator for comprehensive access to process information.
Steps to Compile and Execute
1. Compilation
Use the following command in your MSYS console to compile the program:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o processes_monitor processes_monitor.cpp -lstdc++ -lkernel32 -luser32
processes_monitor.cpp: The name of the source file.
processes_monitor: The name of the output executable.
2. Execution
Run the compiled executable:

bash
Copy code
./processes_monitor
3. Administrator Mode
To ensure full access, run the MSYS console in Administrator mode:

Right-click on your MSYS shortcut.
Select Run as Administrator.
Sample Output
The program displays the running processes in real time, refreshing the list every second:

yaml
Copy code
Listing all running processes:
Process Name: notepad.exe | Process ID: 1234
Process Name: explorer.exe | Process ID: 5678
Process Name: chrome.exe | Process ID: 9012
...
After 10 seconds:

Copy code
Monitoring stopped after 10 seconds.
Customization Options
Change Monitoring Duration:

Modify std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(10)); in the main() function to increase or decrease the monitoring time.
Disable Console Clearing:

Remove or comment out system("cls"); if you prefer not to clear the console between updates.
Troubleshooting
Compilation Errors:

Ensure all required Windows API headers (windows.h, tlhelp32.h) are present.
Install the necessary libraries for your MSYS environment.
Incomplete Process List:

Run the program in Administrator Mode to access all processes.
Author
This program demonstrates basic process monitoring using the Windows API. It is ideal for users looking to understand or analyze running processes on their system. For enhancements or modifications, you can extend this program with additional functionality, such as filtering specific processes or exporting the data to a file.
